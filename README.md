finished first episode of tutorial, learned about

- packages
- JFrame, borders, panels, frames, etc...
- making a main class to do everything

game panel is where we draw the actual game itself

the game frame is where we attack the panel in order to show it to the user

the frame is the game window itself, the panel is attached to the frame(the window)
